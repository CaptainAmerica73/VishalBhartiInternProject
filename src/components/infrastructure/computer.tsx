        A computer lab in schools is a modern and well-equipped space designed
        to enhance digital literacy and technical skills. It features rows of
        computers with updated hardware and software, ergonomic seating, and
        high-speed internet connectivity. The lab provides a hands-on
        environment for students to learn programming, graphic design, data
        analysis, and other computational skills. Interactive whiteboards or
        projectors often aid in teaching, while posters highlighting key
        computer concepts and ethical practices inspire students. The lab
        fosters collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving, preparing
        students for the digital age in a structured and engaging setting.
