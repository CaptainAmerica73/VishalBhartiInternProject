        A classroom is the heart of learning in a school, designed to provide a
        focused and stimulating environment for students. It typically features
        neatly arranged desks and chairs, a teacher’s desk, and a board for
        instruction—either traditional chalkboards or modern whiteboards and
        smartboards. The walls are often adorned with educational charts,
        motivational quotes, and student work, creating a vibrant and inspiring
        atmosphere. Storage cabinets hold books, stationery, and teaching aids,
        while proper lighting and ventilation ensure comfort. A classroom is a
        dynamic space where knowledge is shared, ideas are nurtured, and
        students grow academically and socially.
