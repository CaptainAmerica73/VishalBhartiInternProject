        A science lab in schools is a dynamic and engaging space designed for
        hands-on learning and experimentation. Equipped with essential tools,
        apparatus, and safety equipment, it provides students with opportunities
        to explore scientific concepts practically. The lab typically includes
        workbenches, microscopes, beakers, test tubes, and other specialized
        equipment for physics, chemistry, and biology experiments. Charts,
        models, and educational posters often adorn the walls, inspiring
        curiosity and reinforcing theoretical knowledge. Safety is a top
        priority, with clear guidelines, fire extinguishers, and first-aid kits
        readily available. A science lab is a hub of discovery, fostering
        critical thinking and a love for exploration among students.
